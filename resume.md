## About Me

I'm a passionate computer science student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development. My journey in tech began with simple Python scripts and has evolved into building complex applications and contributing to open-source projects.

Currently pursuing my degree, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks to expand my skill set. I believe in the power of open-source and collaborative development to create impactful solutions.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about the latest advancements in AI, contributing to developer communities, or working on personal projects that challenge my understanding of technology.
